#In this file we discuss about loops and haave some example just for practice
# 

#This is an example for for loop
# x=1
# for i in range(0,20001):
#     print(i)

# colors = ["Red","Green","White","Yellow","blue"]
# for color in colors:
#     print(color)
#     for i in color:
#         print(i)
#         if (i=="e"):
#             print("E is everywhere every one have e")
#         elif(i=="R"):
#             print("Starting alphabat of color")
#         else:
#             print(" ")
    
    
# # This an example for While loop
# x=0
# while (x<9):
#     print(x)
#     x=x+1
    
# count=9 
# while(count<=0):
#     print(count)
#     count=count-1

#Here we are using break statement and continue statement
# table=int(input("Enter the number of table you want : "))
table=2
num=0
while(True):
    if (num==8):
        2
        continue
    print(table,"x",num+1,"=",table*(num+1))
    num=num+1
    
    if (num==10):

        break
    
    
    
print("Thanks")

#here we are taking an example of continue statement
